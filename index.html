    <p class="quote-text">An old Renault is like an overly picky hamster—some days it's running smoothly, rolling with
      the punches, and other days it just sits there in the cage, staring at you like it's judging your every move.
      You'll shake it, you'll coax it, but deep down you know it'll only do what it wants. Yet somehow, despite the
      unpredictability, it's hard not to love the little thing when it finally gets going.</p>
